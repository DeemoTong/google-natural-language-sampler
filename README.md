In [the content category page](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/categories), You can see all categories returned by classify_text method.

### Text Annotation

```bash
$ python examples/text_annotation.py ""
```

## Image Sizing

To enable accurate image detection within the Google Cloud Vision API, images should generally be a minimum of 640 x 480 pixels (about 300k pixels). Full details for different types of Vision API Feature requests are shown below:

| Vision API Feature | Recommended Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| FACE_DETECTION | 1600 x 1200 | Distance between eyes is most important |
| LANDMARK_DETECTION | 640 x 480 |   |
| LOGO_DETECTION | 640 x 480 |   |
| LABEL_DETECTION | 640 x 480 |   |
| TEXT_DETECTION | 1024 x 768 | OCR requires more resolution to detect characters |
| SAFE_SEARCH_DETECTION | 640 x 480 |   |
